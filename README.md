# web-crawling

This repository first contains a simple breadth first program that visualises a BFS algorithm traversing every node in the graph, using libraries like networkx to visualize a graph and matplotlib to plot it.

Then theres a simple **web crawling** tool made using the BFS algorithm and simple tkinter GUI. 
 Web scraping involves systematically fetching web pages, extracting data, and following links to other pages for further data extraction.
